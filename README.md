# Fechnas-Open

This is a fully featured tournament bracket system with cookie based authentication for users to participate in tournaments. Provides UserCP for signup, checkin and reporting results, tournament controls for admins to start a tournament and a nice visual view of the tournament bracket. System is created with StarCraft2 in mind.

Written using plain PHP & MySQL as database holding users & the bracket as tables.

Required MySQL db located at db/opendb.sql, import it with user: root, pw: 123, dbname: opendb as easiest setup. Alternatively use custom name/pw and adjust credentials in the PHP files.
